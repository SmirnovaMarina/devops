## Basic best practices for logging

1. Use logging libraries to produce logs for your app.
2. Define the log level needed. 

I've chosen ```warn``` to monitor all events that can potentially become errors.

3. Log in machine parseable format.

So, my application sends logs in *JSON* format.

4. Don't log excessively or insufficiently. Find the balance.

So, in *docker-compose.yml* I specified that I want to get logs only from containers of Promtail, Loki, Grafana and my app. Also, I limited the maximum size of the log before it is rolled (```max-size```) and the maximum amount of present logs(```max-file```).

5. Donâ€™t log sensitive information.

## Best practices for Promtail

1. Configure ```positions``` block.
This block is responsible for specifying a location where Promtail will save a file indicating how far it has read into a file. In case of a Promtail's restart, the file allows to proceed reading from where Promtail has stopped. Also, you need to performing corresponding mounting in *docker-compose.yml*. 

2. Configure how Promtail will scrape logs in ```scrape_configs```.

## Best practices for Grafana

1. Manage data sources by separate config files in *provisioning/datasources*.
2. Provide a separate file *config.monitoring* with log in cerdentials for Grafana.
3. Manage dashboards by separate config files in *provisioning/dashboards*.
