## Explanations

1. Describe and explain the differences between the output of the command for replicas.

The output of the command for replicas differ due to different starting time. Since pods were not started in parallel, they have different time of visits when liveness probes were done by Kubernetes.

2. Describe why ordering guarantee is unnecessary for the app.

Ordering guarantee is unnecessary for the app because there are no tasks requiring synchronization of replicas or prioritization of requests.
